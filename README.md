Hello World Guide. New to Github and this is just a practice repo

Hello! My name is Anthony, I am as of Saturday April 30th, 2016, a Junior in HighSchool. I love computers, programming, reading books, and of course watching tv and stuff. If I keep this account, it'll be interesting to look back at a couple of years from now. Bonjour future me! Oh, sorry, I mean Salve :D
